# Excel-Calculator
An Excel calculator (built-in inside the excel file) using VBA &amp; Python.
It's all raw coded by me. Basically when you run your main, it opens your existing excel file that has a button (that you will create) which with the code provided, when pressed it opens a calculator that can be used inside your excel file.
